# Initial JavaScript Projeccts

## 5/13/20 Web150 assignment 3: constructing and displaying objects
cat-object/ fulfills the assignment requirements for constructing two objects using constructor function notation and displaying them via a webpage on the browser with JS. routine-object/ and routine-object.js show the experimentation that I did in trying to set up a more complex object concept that could be built out further as a "routine tracker app" practice project.
